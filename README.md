# Customer-conversion-prediction

# Project Goal
The goal of the Customer Conversion Prediction project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a client will subscribe to the insurance based on their demographic and marketing data. The project aims to help the insurance company identify the customers that are most likely to convert, so that they can be targeted via call and the cost of telephonic marketing campaigns can be reduced. The historical sales data provided will be used to train and evaluate the performance of the machine learning models. The analysis of the model will be done to identify the important factors that contribute towards the conversion and the AUROC metric will be used to evaluate the model's performance. The main objective of the project is to develop an accurate and efficient model that can aid the insurance company in improving its sales conversion rate and reducing marketing costs.

# Project Aproach:

1. Libraries Import and Load Dataset
2. Clean Dataset
3. Exploritory Data Analysis
4. Encoding
5. Split Dataset
6. Scalling
7. Models
8. Model Evaluation

# Conclusion : 

Based on the results obtained from the evaluation of the three classification models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Decision Tree Classifier) on the given historical data, XGBoost outperformed the other models with the highest accuracy score of 93.54% and the highest AUROC score of 0.986.

This implies that XGBoost is a suitable model for predicting whether a client will subscribe to the insurance or not. It is recommended to deploy this model in the production environment to accurately target potential customers and optimize marketing costs.

However, further analysis is recommended to identify the important features contributing to the model's performance and to fine-tune the model for better results.
